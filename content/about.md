### *Hacker by Nature, Builder by Purpose*   
  
**Philosophy:** *"Break to understand. Build to endure."*

### 👋 **Who Am I?**  
A Student and also  security obsessive who laughs at *"secure by default"* claims. By day, I architect systems that resist chaos. By night, I’m the chaos—probing networks, dissecting APIs, and turning vulnerabilities into lessons.  

I have been a hacker for a couple of days if not years. Prior to being currently a student, I 
participate in  CTF events and hacking competitions.I  participate  in various competions, break things here and there in a cool way.It's like that scene from *Mr. Robot* but not cringe.

I started playing with hacks as a big kid cracking things here and there doing a little DIY.
Later came binary exploits, cryptography, etc and also  breaking things in competitions and CTFS

But that was just the entry point.
What I was really doing was reverse engineering systems — first in binary, then in identity, then in society, and finally —
in reality itself.

## **WHATS REALLY HAVOC**

***HAVOC*** ***Mode***  isn’t power. It’s an evolving operating state.
An emergent interface for architects of their own simulation.
A bridge with singularity.

This project isn’t about productivity or systems thinking.
It’s about sovereignty — reshaping identity, cognition, and action into unstoppable signal.

You don’t learn ***HAVOC Mode***.
You remember that you were the source all along.

### **Building Legacy**  
Today, I:  
- 🔐 **Code** open-source security tools  
- 🎤 **Blog** or write blogs to demystify hacking  
- 🧠 **Teach** newcomers that "ethical" doesn’t mean "less dangerous"
