# **MY THOUGHTS ON BEING A HACKER**

![hacker](https://media0.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExd3hjOWR5YTNlY3Z1dm15cmpzcmxqeWw3bXVwY3k1OGExZ3I5MGxmdCZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/goKgmdgnBfbYhsZFy9/giphy.gif)

A *hacker* is someone who understands how the world works. It's about 
knowing what happens when you type "google.com" and press Enter. It's 
about knowing how your computer turns on, about memory training, A20, 
all of that. It's about modern processors, their caches, and their side 
channels. It's about DSi bootloaders and how the right electromagnetic 
faults can be used to jailbreak them. And it's about how Spotify and 
Widevine and AES and SGX work so you can free your music from the 
shackles of DRM.

But being a hacker is so much more than these things. It's about knowing 
where to find things. Like libgen and Sci-Hub and nyaa. Or where to get 
into the latest IDA Pro group buy. Or which trackers have what and how 
to get into them.

It's about knowing how to bypass email verification. How to bypass SMS 
verification. How to bypass that stupid fucking verification where you 
hold your driver's license up to a webcam (thank you, OBS virtual camera!) 
Having an actual threat model not just paranoia. Knowing that you're not 
worth burning a 0day on, but reading indictments to learn from others' 
mistakes.

It's about knowing how to negotiate your salary (or equity). It's about 
knowing why things at the supermarket cost what they do. Or how that awful 
shitcoin keeps pumping. And why that dogshit startup got assigned that 
insane valuation. And understanding who really pays for it in the end 
(hint: it's you).

My point is, it is not just about computers. It's about understanding how 
the world works. The world is made up of people. As much as machines keep 
society running, those machines are programmed by people--people with 
managers, spouses, and children; with wants, needs, and dreams. And it is 
about using that knowledge to bring about the change you want to see.

In my Opinion that is what being a hacker is all about.

### **|=---=[ Closing Thoughts]**

If someone tells you hacking is dead, it is because they are not involved in
real hacking. They might have been. They might want to be. And that has
nothing to do with their technical knowledge or ability. It just is. And if
anyone tries to speak for all hackers, or for all hacking, they don't.
